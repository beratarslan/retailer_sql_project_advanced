# **E-Commerce Sales Analysis Project**

### **Difficulty Level: Advanced**

## **Project Overview**

In this project, I explored a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an e-commerce platform, diving deep into customer behavior, product performance, and overall sales trends using PostgreSQL.

Throughout the analysis, I tackled key business challenges such as revenue tracking, customer segmentation, and inventory optimization. Additionally, I focused on data cleaning, managing missing values, and crafting structured queries to extract meaningful insights.

To provide a clearer understanding of the database structure, Iâ€™ve also included an ERD diagram that visually maps out the relationships between different tables.
